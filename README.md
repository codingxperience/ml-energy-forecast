# Energy Consumption Prediction

This repository contains code for an energy consumption prediction application. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow, and it allows users to predict energy consumption based on various input parameters.

## Features

- Predict energy consumption for different zones
- Input parameters include temperature, humidity, wind speed, hour, day of week, quarter, month, and day of year
- Models are trained using historical data and machine learning techniques

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

1. Select the zone for which you want to make a prediction.
2. Enter the input parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
3. Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted energy consumption.
